Arrowhead DataManager

Must fix:
1) Username and password for web login (now hardcoded to user/password: test/test)
2) HTTPS
3) AH Framework support for
   - Authorization & Acess control
   - Orchestration and Configuration client
4) Other DataManager services (Proxy, etc.)
5) Update IDD+SD+SySD+SysDD documents
6) Protect web pages from being accessed without a login session
7) 

To test, open web browser and direct to http://127.0.0.1:4001
Login to the web interface with username and password: test/test
