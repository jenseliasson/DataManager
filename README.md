Must fix:
1) Username and password for web login (now hardcoded to user/password: test/test)
2) AH Framework support for
   - Authorization & Acess control
   - Orchestration and Configuration client
3) Other DataManager services (Proxy, etc.)
4) Update IDD+SD+SySD+SysDD documents
5) ...

To test, open web browser and direct to http://127.0.0.1:4001
